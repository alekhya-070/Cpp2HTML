## HTMLGenerator Library

**HTMLGenerator** is a C++ library for creating HTML documents programmatically. It provides classes for various HTML elements such as labels, images, links, tables, and more, allowing you to generate structured HTML content directly in C++.

---
The use of this C++ to HTML project could offer several advantages despite HTML being easier to write directly. Here are some potential uses:
1. **Automation and Efficiency**: If you're working on large-scale websites or applications that require repetitive HTML structures, your C++ to HTML library could automate the generation of HTML code, saving time and reducing human error.
2. **Code Reusability**: In larger projects, it's often beneficial to separate logic (written in C++) from presentation (written in HTML). This project would allow developers to write their application logic in C++ while automatically generating the necessary HTML output, making the codebase cleaner and more modular.
3. **Integration with C++ Programs**: For projects that are built in C++ and need to output web-based content (for example, C++ applications that involve interactive data visualization), your library would allow seamless conversion to HTML for front-end display.
4. **Dynamic Content Generation**: The library could dynamically generate HTML content based on various inputs or conditions, making it useful for creating customizable websites where the content depends on C++ logic or computations.
5. **Learning Tool**: It could also be a valuable educational tool, helping students and developers learn how to bridge programming languages and technologies (like C++ and HTML) in a real-world application.


## Features

- **Labels:** Create styled text elements with customizable colors and tags.
- **Images:** Embed images with source URLs and alt texts.
- **Links:** Add hyperlinks with text and destination URLs.
- **Tables:** Build tables with dynamic rows and cells.
- **Document Structure:** Combine multiple elements into structured HTML documents.
